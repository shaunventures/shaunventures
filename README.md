## About

I am a skilled data professional with over five years of experience in GIS and data analysis, specialising in developing scalable data pipelines and implementing effective data strategies. I have successfully managed teams and workflows, delivering complex data insights to senior stakeholders. My expertise includes leveraging GIS and analytics for strategic decision-making and data visualisation, utilising tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and PostgreSQL.

Outside of work, I enjoy long-distance running, exploring environmental data projects, and learning new technical skills such as Python and cloud-based geospatial workflows.
